Click on "Take Me To My Home" when you are done adding areas to your home. Here we will be directed to the "My Homes" page where you will be presented with your newly added home and any areas assigned to it. The next step here is optional but if you want you can add an "Attribute" to an area. For example: In the living room, we have an attribute of "Ceiling Fan". To do this, click the drop down arrow on your home area card and click "Add Attribute". Then fill in the form with the attribute type of your choice and click "Save Attribute".

Add Attribute Detail (Optional):  
![Add Attribute Detail](client/public/addattributedetail.gif)

To give our attribute more specificity, we can give it a detail, a detail value, and an associated date. For example: Our ceiling fan has a detail of "Purchased from home depot", our detail value is a link to where the fan was purchased online, and a date is assigned to remind us when our fan was purchased. To do this, click on the blue attribute link and fill out each form. Once done, click "Save Detail".

Generate Report:  
![Generate Report](client/public/generatereport.gif)

To generate a report, simply click on "Generate Report". A PDF file will be generated containing the home, all of its areas, attributes, and details formatted nicely. You can even click on detail links if provided in the details.

Transfer Home:  
![Transfer Home](client/public/transferhome.gif)

If a user wants to transfer a home and all of its areas/attributes/details, all they need to do is click "Transfer Home" and enter the recipients valid email address that they use to log into homefaxt with, then click "Transfer Home". The transferrer can immediately navigate back to the "My Homes" page and see they no longer have that home in their list. Once the reciever logs back in, a bell notification will be displayed with a number of pending transfers in red. Once they click the notification, they can choose to accept or decline the transfer. After the home is accepted, they can navigate to their "My Homes" page and see that the home has successfully been transferred into their account.

Other Features:
If a user wants to remove a house from their homes page manually, they can do so in their "My Homes" page. If the user navigates to the "Profile" page, they can update their email address, first and last names, password, and even delete their account entirely.
